# Gloomhaven Modifier Deck
Gloomhaven is a cooperative, dungeon-crawl, campaign-based board game designed by Isaac Childres and released in 2017. For those unfamiliar with the game or its style, think of it as a more structured Dungeons & Dragons. The popularity of Gloomhaven led to a few expansions and sequels.  

One of the key mechanics in the Gloomhaven series is attacking.  Once an attack is declared, a character then draws a card from a deck that modifies the attack value.
